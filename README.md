IndoBERT Verify is a robust AI-powered system developed to detect hoaxes in Indonesian news articles with high accuracy and interpretability. At its core is the IndoBERT language model, an Indonesian-specific BERT variant pre-trained on large-scale native text corpora. This tailored linguistic foundation allows the system to effectively analyze context, semantics, and phrasing that are unique to Indonesian media. As a result, it identifies misinformation more reliably than general-purpose language models.

Designed for real-world use, IndoBERT Verify provides real-time predictions to determine whether a given news article is likely a hoax. Users can simply input text into the system and receive immediate results. This instant feedback makes the tool highly practical for journalists, educators, fact-checkers, researchers, and the general public who need fast and accurate credibility assessments without relying on manual verification.

In addition to its classification capabilities, the system offers detailed confidence scoring for each result. Rather than providing only a final label, IndoBERT Verify shows the probability of each class, such as "hoax" or "non-hoax." This scoring allows users to evaluate how certain the model is about its judgment, especially in ambiguous cases. It adds a valuable layer of transparency and can help organizations prioritize content that requires human review.

Another key feature is the system‚Äôs ability to explain its decisions through interpretable outputs. IndoBERT Verify uses attention-based explainable AI techniques to highlight which words in the input text had the greatest influence on the prediction. This visual feedback helps users understand why a particular result was generated, increasing trust in the model while also serving as an educational tool for spotting misinformation patterns in the language itself.

## üèãÔ∏è Model Training

Model is trained using the [UMPO Hoax Dataset](https://github.com/) with the following pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning** (remove URLs, symbols, hashtags)
2. **Label Encoding** using `LabelEncoder`
3. **Tokenization** with `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1")`
4. **Training** via HuggingFace `Trainer` API
5. **Evaluation** with confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score

## üöÄ Backend (Flask + Transformers)

The backend is built using **Flask** and serves a fine-tuned IndoBERT model for hoax classification. It exposes a `/predict` endpoint that:

- Accepts raw text via a POST request.
- Returns a prediction (`0 = non-hoax`, `1 = hoax`).
- Provides a confidence score for each class.
- Uses `transformers-interpret` to highlight word-level attribution for explainability.

The backend also uses **Ngrok** to expose the local Flask server to a public URL, making it accessible from the frontend or external tools during development.

## üåê Frontend (Vue.js + Tailwind CSS)

The frontend is a **Vue.js** application built with **Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to:

- Input news text manually.
- Send the text to the backend for classification.
- Display the predicted result with confidence scores.
- Visualize keyword influence using color-coded highlights.

The frontend communicates with the Flask backend through API calls to the exposed Ngrok URL.

## üñ•Ô∏è Application Overview

The home page of the IndoBERT Verify application presents a sleek, dark-themed interface with orange accents that introduces users to its core purpose: detecting hoaxes in Indonesian news using the IndoBERT language model. At the top, it features a navigation bar with links to Home, News Detection, and About sections. The central hero section displays the app's name and a concise description emphasizing real-time, transparent, AI-powered hoax detection. Below that, three highlighted feature cards explain its key strengths which is AI-powered classification, real-time results, and confidence scoring. At the bottom, two prominent buttons invite users to either begin the detection process or learn more about the app, creating an intuitive and engaging entry point for new users.

The News Detection page of the IndoBERT Verify app allows users to input and analyze text to determine whether it's likely a hoax. In the screenshot example, a sample news article claiming NASA announced the sun will go dark for six days due to a ‚ÄúGalactic Blackout‚Äù is entered into the detection box. After clicking the ‚ÄúDetect‚Äù button, the system processes the input using a fine-tuned IndoBERT model and returns a prediction. In this case, the result displays a "Prediction: Likely Hoax" with a confidence score of 82.6%, indicating that the model strongly believes the news is not credible.

The News Detection page of IndoBERT Verify not only displays the prediction result but also includes a powerful feature called Keyword Attributions, located just below the prediction section. This feature highlights individual words or phrases from the input text that had the most influence on the model's classification decision.

In the example shown, each highlighted word (e.g., NASA, padam, badai, fenomena) is visually marked in orange tags, making it easy for users to identify which parts of the sentence contributed most to the ‚ÄúLikely Hoax‚Äù prediction. This interpretability component is powered by transformers-interpret, providing transparency and building user trust by showing how and why the model arrived at its conclusion. It helps users not only see the result, but understand the reasoning behind it.
